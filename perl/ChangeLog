	* run-until-found.sh: First run with p128, blocksize 100 results:
	real	17m52.632s
user	7m37.530s
sys	0m49.720s

	Several bug fixes on the fly, one of them made reaper not delay
	after none was eliminated.

	* Running again experiments, I made a msitake and put two
	reproducers (which were mainly hungry) instead of two
	evaluators. Took less time, but obtained a max fitness of 90 or
	so. 

	* evaluate-pop-loop.pl: Changed evaluate to start with rand(), to
	avoid problems. 

	* base.yaml (base_population): Setting base population to 128 for
	the first set of experiments.
