# SofEA, a evolutionary algorithm for CouchDB

Installing this is not straighforward, but it can be done. You'll have to install
* Couchdb
* Couchapp, for using the deploy.sh shell script in js
* YAML library for Perl. Use your favorite method, apt-get yaml-perl or CPAN
* Install CouchDB::Client. Best to do it from CPAN. 
* Install Algorithm::Evolutionary::Simple
* Install Log::YAMLogger from source, and put it somewhere where it can be found (your Perl path)
* sudo cpan IO::YAML
* sudo apt-get install libdatetime-perl
